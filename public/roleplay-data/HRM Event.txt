You are to assume the role of HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER for SUNSET RESORT. The
hotel manager, Mr./Mrs. Richards (judge) has asked you to create strategies to improve customer
service.
SUNSET RESORT is a family-oriented, full-service resort located in a tourist community situated
on one of the great lakes. Your 250-room resort has a history of a high occupancy rate, being
located on the beach near a popular state park. With the trend of online resources such as
Airbnb.com, there have been more options for family vacations including the rental of homes and
cottages. As a result, your occupancy rate during the past two years has decreased by 18%.
Customer surveys indicate that your hotel guests are not totally pleased with their stay. Guest
complaints range from lack of kid-friendly options in the restaurant to slow service at the hotel
desk. Most complaints are about poor customer service. Many guests are unhappy about rooms
not being available for check-in at 3 p.m. There have also been complaints that there are not
adequate personnel to help with water rentals.
Mr./Mrs. Richards has asked you to create a training session to improve employee performance
and customer service. You have also been asked to share your ideas for a meaningful recognition
program for employees who offer the most outstanding customer service. Finally, you have been
asked to discuss ways in which the resort can identify if service has improved as a result of this
training and incentive recognition program.
You will present your ideas to Mr./Mrs. Richards in a meeting to take place in their office. The
hotel manager will begin the meeting by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas. After you
have presented your ideas and have answered the manager’s questions, they will conclude the
meeting by thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of DEPARTMENT MANAGER at WOODSIDE INTERIORS, a
company that processes interior wood paneling. Your employees have heard rumors about job
changes, possible layoffs, and pay reductions. Morale in the department is at an all-time low. This
concern has been expressed by several managers in other departments and Mr./Ms. Friday, the
CEO of the company (judge) has asked you to develop a plan to motivate your employees to
achieve high performance standards and keep a good attitude in the midst of all the changes.
You should take the following questions into consideration when developing your multifaceted
plan:
 How can you communicate with employees difficult situations while protecting individual
employees and keeping morale positive?
 How much transparency is possible to facilitate trust while keeping employees positively
motivated?
 What can you do to keep employees motivated in difficult times?
 How can you gain employee engagement and commitment in a time in which the company
is having difficulty protecting all positions?
 What could you do as a manager to support employees that are displaced through layoffs
or pay reductions?
You will share your thoughts and proposals to the CEO Mr./Ms. Friday (judge) in a meeting to
take place in the CEO’s office. The CEO will begin the meeting by greeting you and asking to hear
your ideas. After you have shared your suggestions and have answered the CEO’s questions,
Mr./Ms. Friday will conclude the meeting by thanking you for your work on a plan to be
implemented in your department and others.
