You are the MANAGER of a local car dealership, SMITH AUTO SALES. You will be meeting
with Mr./Ms. Jones (judge), a recent customer who has purchased a new sports utility vehicle 15
months prior to the meeting today. Mr./Ms. Jones has requested a meeting with you because he/she
is unhappy with the Wi-Fi___33 contract for the new vehicle.
The vehicle purchased, The SuperSport, is a midsized SUV that is promoted toward families and
adventure travelers. This vehicle has many amenities, but the service that was most attractive to
Mr./Ms. Jones was the free SuperSport 4G LTE Wi-Fi. The SuperSport Wi-Fi___33 boasts a
strong signal, the ability to stream movies and television on the go, connect seven devices within
the one vehicle, and an in-vehicle app to keep track of the data plan.
During the sales process, the salesperson who sold the vehicle had told Mr./Ms. Jones that the WiFi___33 was free, but failed to disclose that the Wi-Fi___33 was free for only the first three months
after the purchase of the vehicle. However, the paperwork that Mr./Ms. Jones signed to complete
the purchase of the vehicle clearly identified that the free Wi-Fi___33 was temporary and a $17
monthly fee would be added to every monthly vehicle payment. Mr./Ms. Jones has been using and
paying for the Wi-Fi___33 services for the past 12 months. Mr./Ms. Jones is requesting a refund
of $204. Since the fees for the Wi-Fi___33 services are contracted out to another company and a
small portion of the profit actually goes to the car dealership, a refund is not an ideal solution for
SMITH AUTO SALES.
You will meet with Mr./Ms. Jones in the dealership conference room. You will begin the meeting
by greeting him/her and will explain the business policy in an effort to keep Mr./Ms. Jones as a
Wi-Fi___33 customer. After you have answered his/her questions, you will conclude the meeting
by thanking Mr./Ms. Jones.

You are a SALESPERSON at WINDEKA, a local “Best Price” car dealership. You will be meeting
with a new client, Mr./Ms. Clarkson (judge), who is shopping for a new car, and has already done
some pre-shopping online. In the initial meet and greet portion of your meeting, your goal is to
help them understand the difference between a Best Price Dealership and a Negotiating
Dealership. In addition to helping the client understand your brand promise, you will need to
interpret your dealership pricing policies and discuss the legal and ethical considerations between
the two types of dealerships.
Best Price Dealerships, also known as “No-Haggle Dealerships”, set their prices based on cost
plus mark-up. Depending on the dealership, this could be the MSRP or a lower percentage pricing
policy. Most customers feel that negotiating prices is the worst part about buying a car. They trust
the Best Price experience.
Shopping a Negotiating Dealership requires bargaining skills from everything to price, trade-in
values, financing and services. Most people are not skilled in those areas, and in many cases makes
them feel uncomfortable. Car salespeople seem to be stereotyped as unethical and pushy in order
to make their commissions, and in some cases even steering customers to different buys just to
make their commissions higher. With a no-haggle policy, salespeople are paid on volume sold
rather than dollars.
Some customers still try to haggle, but when a dealership advertises “No-Haggling” or “Best Price”
they need to, under the Truth in Advertising laws, stay true to their price. If caught negotiating the
price, the salesperson could get fired. Plus it is just bad business to allow a lower price for one,
and not for others. If word got out, the reputation of the dealership could be damaged.
Your new client, Mr./Ms. Clarkson (judge), has done some pre-shopping online and is waiting for
you to greet them in your office. You will begin the meeting by greeting Mr./Ms. Clarkson. Once
you have answered all of their questions, they will thank you for meeting with them and conclude
the meeting.
