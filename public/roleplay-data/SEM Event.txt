You are to assume the role of TICKET SALES MANAGER for the NORTHWOODS COUNTRY
FAIR. Your fair runs annually the second week in July for six days. The Northwoods Country
Fair is known for some great grandstand acts, live entertainment, amusement rides, various
agricultural exhibits, and many food and drink concessions.
The manager, Mr./Ms. Flanders (judge), of the touring “TMX Professional Bicycle Stunt Team”
has asked you the best way to market and distribute tickets to their “new” secondary market. This
market is parents and grandparents (35-60 years old) of their current primary market which is preteens and young adults (8-24 years old).
The TMX team will be performing daily during the six days of the fair. They will be at main
grandstand which seats up to 3000 people. Tickets are needed to see any grandstand show and are
$10 for bleacher seats and $20 for the front ten rows of chairs. Your fair and the TMX group split
all ticket sales 50/50 (50% for the fair and 50% for the TMX team).
Daily attendance at the fair ranges from 8,000 to 15,000 visitors. These customers are of all ages
but the primary market for the fair is rural residence within forty miles. There are three small cities
of 25,000 to 45,000 in population located in that geographic region along with ten small towns
1000-3000 in population.
Mr./Ms. Flanders knows from past experiences their primary market (8-24 yrs. old) will fill
approximately 25% of the main grand stand at your venue. Many of this target group buys tickets
to multiple shows. The tour manager is willing to work with you on ideas for sales promotions
and ticket distribution ideas to area groups that fit their “new” secondary market of (35-60 yrs.
old). This group of customers may or may not already be customers of the fair. Due to ticket
prices being relatively inexpensive, Mr./Ms. Flanders has requested to keep the marketing budget
reasonably small. The tour manager has requested sales promotions, “specials,” and public
relations activities to increase ticket sales and distribution. Also, any media used should be focused
on early July.
You will present your ideas and recommendations to Mr./Ms. Flanders in a meeting to take place
in their office. The tour manager will begin the meeting by greeting you and asking to hear your
ideas. After you have presented your recommendations and have answered the tour manager’s
questions, they will conclude the meeting by thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of PARK MANAGER of SUNSET PARK, an outdoor entertainment
park area. Mr./Ms. Thomas, the City Council President (judge), has come to you with a request.
The council members have noticed the park is heavily used during the summer on weekdays, is
rarely used on weekends, and in fall, winter, and spring the park is very slow with activity.
Sunset Park is located in a downtown area of the city of Manawa (population 41,000) and is owned
and operated by the city. Sunset Park has:
 a five hundred seat amphitheater
 a softball field
 two sand volleyball courts
 a walking/jogging loop that is ½ mile in length
Sunset Park has free summer concerts at the amphitheater every Thursday, a busy farmer’s market
Wednesday and Saturday mornings (June-Oct), children’s games/sports Monday through
Thursday all summer, and senior citizen yoga on Monday and Wednesday mornings (April-Oct).
The council has decided they would like to increase revenue by renting out the facilities more
often. The council has done some research with their districts and they have found that:
1) Many people did not realize all that Sunset Park had to offer
2) Few people realized they could rent the facilities for family or business group activities
The council would like you, the park manager (participant) to create the following to increase
interest for the park:
 Develop a brand/image for Sunset Park that appeals to a variety of market segments
 Coordinate promotional activities to get local residents to rent the facilities (Identify
specific markets: family, business events, other)
One issue which the council president (judge) is worried about is the fact that two of the council
member’s city districts are next to the park. The residents in those two neighborhoods are worried
if the park gets too busy the noise and traffic will be too much for their streets to handle. The
council president (judge) thought it would be nice to give a special promotional deal for the
residents living next to the park.
You will present your ideas to Mr./Ms. Thomas, the council president (judge), in their office. The
council president will start the meeting by asking to hear your ideas for the park. After your ideas
are presented and the council president has asked their questions, they will thank you for your
time.
