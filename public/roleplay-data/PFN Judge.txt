JUDGE SITUATION CHARACTERIZATION
You are to assume the role of a new bank teller at SMALL CITY BANK, a local banking institution
in a city of 10,000 people. You work with three other bank tellers. You have asked one of the
bank tellers (participant) to talk about the non-financial aspects of the job.
While SMALL CITY BANK is located in a small town, it services the financial needs of a majority
of citizens of the town and the surrounding region. Everyday the lobby is full of bank customers
waiting in line to deposit or withdraw money, pay on a line of credit, apply for a line of credit or
open new accounts. The bank offers savings accounts, certificates of deposits and low interest
rates on automobile, housing and personal loans.
You have completed the appropriate industry-related training involved with starting a job as a
bank teller. You have asked one of the other bank tellers (participant) to explain other skills the
job entails. You want to know about communications among bank customers and employees and
how positive relationships are made among both.
Your coworker (participant) will explain knowledge of emotional intelligence to you in a roleplay to take place in your office. You will begin the role-play by asking about emotional
intelligence. During the course of the role-play you are to ask the following questions of each
participant:
1. Why is having good emotional skills as important as good financial skills?
2. Why do bank customers care so much about confidentiality?
After your coworker (participant) has given you an explanation and has answered your questions,
you will conclude the role-play by thanking your coworker (participant).
You are not to make any comments after the event is over except to thank the participant.
Answers will vary but should demonstrate a basic understanding of the concepts.

JUDGE SITUATION CHARACTERIZATION
You are to assume the role of an accountant at GEORGE & KEEN, an accounting firm that
manages over 300 business clients. The firm recently began allowing employees to work from
home. You do not understand why security training is necessary to be able to work from home.
A coworker (participant) will describe basic reasons why security is important when working
away from the office.
GEORGE & KEEN is the most trusted accounting firm in the region. With over 300 business
clients and over 200 employees, the firm is well-known. Since it opened in 1967, GEORGE &
KEEN has kept traditional office space, offering executives full offices and other staff members
cubicles. The majority of the accounting work is done via computer rather than face-to-face
client interaction, so not much space is needed.
To keep up with current business trends, executives at GEORGE & KEEN have begun letting
accountants work from home. Accountants are issued a company laptop and other equipment and
must have high speed internet capabilities in their workspace. Before the new work from home
initiative begins, executives have insisted that all employees that want to work from home must
attend a mandatory security training regarding company information, client information and
company equipment.
You are unhappy about the mandatory security training and do not understand why it is
necessary. The coworker (participant) must explain to you the basic reasons why the training is
essential.
Your coworker (participant) will explain basic reasons for security training to you in a role-play
to take place in your cubicle. You will begin the role-play by asking about the training. During
the course of the role-play you are to ask the following questions of each participant:
1. Should the company provide security training to ALL employees?
2. How does allowing employees to work from home benefit the company?
After your coworker (participant) has given you an explanation and has answered your questions,
you will conclude the role-play by thanking your coworker (participant).
You are not to make any comments after the event is over except to thank the participant.
Answers will vary but should demonstrate a basic understanding of the concepts.
