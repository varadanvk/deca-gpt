You are to assume the roles of the director of sales and the director of membership at YOUNG
CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS, a performing arts venue located in a city of 700,000 people.
The executive director of the venue (judge) has asked you to redesign the membership program
in preparation for next season’s exciting showcase.
YOUNG CENTER permanently houses the city’s opera, symphony orchestra and the ballet. In
addition, several times during the season, traveling musicians, musicals, plays and other special
events are hosted by the venue.
YOUNG CENTER offers a membership program for arts-focused community members that often
attend performances at the venue and would like perks. Memberships are valid for one calendar
year from the time of purchase. The following is a breakdown of the three membership tiers,
price and perks:
Basic Membership: Includes a behind-the-scenes tour of the venue, access to the private
members only lounge, and 24-hour pre-sale for all events before ticket sales begin for the general
public. Cost: $150.00
Mid-Level Membership: Includes all basic membership perks, plus two parking garage vouchers,
48-hour pre-sale for all events, name in event programs, and 20% off beverages in the lounges.
Cost: $300.00
Premiere Membership: Includes all basic and mid-level membership perks, plus access to VIP
private parking lot, access to open rehearsals, private parties, and 72-hour pre-sale for all events
before ticket sales begin for the general public. Cost: $600.00
Executives at the YOUNG CENTER have received confirmation that the extremely popular
Broadway musical, Founding Fathers, will be traveling next year and YOUNG CENTER will be
one of the stops during the tour. Founding Fathers will have eight shows at YOUNG CENTER.
Founding Fathers is the most popular musical of the year, with tickets selling out in record time.
The executive director (judge) knows that once it is announced that Founding Fathers will be
performed at YOUNG CENTER, people will be desperate to purchase tickets. The only way to
purchase tickets in advance of the general public is to purchase a membership. Currently all three
membership tiers allow members to purchase tickets in advance.
The executive director (judge) feels that there will be a huge influx of new members once
Founding Fathers is announced. In anticipation, the executive director (judge) wants you to
redesign the membership program. The executive director (judge) wants you to adjust the prices
and perks at each membership tier that will best benefit YOUNG CENTER as well as the members.
You will present the membership program to the executive director (judge) in a meeting to take

FOOTBALL CLUB (BTFC), an American professional soccer team that competes in the Major
Soccer League (MSL). The president of the organization (judge) has asked you to develop the
promotion of the team’s charity fundraiser.
BIG TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB began play in 1996 as one of the charter teams in the league. The
team has reached the MSL Cup several times, but unfortunately has never won. The team has
several players that are considered sports celebrities and has high attendance at each home game,
oftentimes reaching the 25,000 maximum capacity.
One of BTFC’s players has a mother suffering from complications from diabetes. The team as a
whole has rallied around the player and the player’s mother as she suffers from complications.
The president of BTFC (judge) has decided that the team will spearhead a fundraising effort for
diabetes research in honor of the player’s mother. The funds raised will go to DIABETES
RESEARCH FUND. The president (judge) knows that with thousands of loyal BTFC fans, the
charity is sure to receive many donations.
BIG TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB partnered with CHARITY ANGEL, a crowdfunding platform that
works exclusively with fundraising efforts for charities and nonprofits. To spark interest and to
create an element of fun, the fundraiser has been set up to blend with in-game performance. The
public is able to pledge a certain dollar amount for a one-time donation or can pledge per shoton-goal by BTFC. If a person pledged $1 for every shot-on-goal, for example, and there are 76
shots-on-goal, the person will donate $76.00. In addition, BTFC has agreed to donate a portion
of all ticket sales to DIABETES RESEARCH FUND.
The president (judge) is excited to begin promoting this fundraising event. The president (judge)
has asked you to develop the promotional plan that will introduce this exciting and important
fundraising event to the BTFC fans and to the public. The president (judge) wants you to include
types of promotion, communications channels and marketing strategies in your plan.

president’s (judge’s) office. The president (judge) will begin the meeting by greeting you and
asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented the promotion and have answered the

for your work.
