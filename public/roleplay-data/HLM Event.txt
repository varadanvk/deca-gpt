You are to assume the role of an Intern in the Sales and Marketing Department of a large
resort property located in a popular tourism area. Tahotel is privately owned by a third
generation family since 1912. The owner, Mr./Miss Peyton Collins (judge), was born and raised
in the industry. The owner (judge) realizes that sales and marketing practices have changed
dramatically in the past decade and feels it is time to move into the 21st Century. The owner
(judge) has asked you to prepare an explanation of how to use social media to achieve a fresh
branded image of the property.
Real time marketing and providing content on an ongoing basis dominates the hospitality
industry but the owner is out of touch with these new marketing tools. Tahotel still values the
impact of traditional marketing, but feels real time marketing must take place on a regular basis
and must incorporate guest-generated content, especially via social media.
Areas the owner is looking to explore include your property’s Facebook as a supplement to the
website with the option for guests to contact hotel staff and make reservations. The owner also
read about an App that pulls information about the property from the hotel’s website onto its
Facebook page but has no idea what that means. Some apps provide a link through which guests
can book a room directly on the property’s website. Facebook pages also have custom apps that
can highlight a hotel’s unique features, characteristics, and charm.
The owner has also read about video campaigns on social media, when done properly, are
proving to be successful for hoteliers looking to generate guest engagement, but thinks this could
be expensive. Provide your insight on this venue. The owner has seen an increase in
interactions with the hotel, seeing shared personal experiences by guests with friends and family
and needs clarification of its value in promoting the property and guest engagement.
Finally, the days of “walk-in” reservations are dwindling. You have done some research and
found out that with mobile apps such as Hotel Tonight and others, guests rarely walk in to
inquire about room availability. Instead, they turn to apps and mobile websites, so helping the
owner (judge) understand what an app is and these options would be helpful.
Your task is to help the owner understand the impact of social media as a branding and
promotional tool and help them distinguish between social media options and purposes.
Remember to talk about how video is used online for promotional purposes. Explain what an
App is and how it can be used for Tahotel.
You will present to Peyton Collins, owner (judge), in a role-play to take place in the owner’s
office. The owner (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas
about social media promotions for the hotel. After you have presented and answered the owner’s
questions, the judge will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of general manager at MADDER LAKE INN, a full-service hotel
located in a city of 200,000 people. The restaurant manager (judge) has expressed concerns about
the number of open tables at the hotel’s restaurant and wants your help in creating marketing
strategies that will bring in local community members to the restaurant.
MADDER LAKE INN is located right on Madder Lake and offers guests easy access to hiking trails
along with canoe and kayak rentals. Along with a lounge and a coffee shop, the hotel offers a full
service restaurant, LAKESIDE. LAKESIDE is situated right on the banks of Madder Lake and
offers indoor seating in an elegant dining room and outdoor seating on a beautiful patio. The fullservice menu offers midscale prices on locally grown and sourced items.
At first, guests shied away from dining at LAKESIDE due to the midscale prices. When asked,
guests stated they would rather go off property than paying higher prices on meals on-site. To
help remedy the situation, each guest at MADDER LAKE INN receives a discount while dining at
LAKESIDE. When charging to a guest room or presenting a room key, the guest receives 20% off
the bill. This discount has led to an increase in the number of guests dining at LAKESIDE,
however the dining room consistently remains only half full.
The restaurant manager (judge) is proud of LAKESIDE, but understands that many community
members simply do not even consider LAKESIDE as an option for dining out because it is
affiliated with the hotel. The restaurant manager (judge) feels that if more people in the
community knew about the beautiful location and locally grown menu items, they would
consider dining at a hotel restaurant.
The restaurant manager (judge) wants your help in creating marketing strategies that will bring in
local community members to dine at LAKESIDE. The restaurant manager (judge) wants to know
the specific market you will target, strategies used to get them to dine at LAKESIDE and any
unique selling propositions LAKESIDE can use to build a local clientele.
You will present your ideas to the restaurant manager (judge) in a role-play to take place in the
restaurant manager’s (judge’s) office. The restaurant manager (judge) will begin the role-play by
greeting you and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented your ideas and have
answered the restaurant manager’s (judge’s) questions, the restaurant manager (judge) will
conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.
