You are to assume the role of a bank teller at SMALL CITY BANK, a local banking institution in a
city of 10,000 people. You work with three other bank tellers, one of them is a new hire. The
new bank teller (judge) has asked you to talk about the non-financial aspects of the job.
While SMALL CITY BANK is located in a small town, it services the financial needs of a majority
of citizens of the town and the surrounding region. Everyday the lobby is full of bank customers
waiting in line to deposit or withdraw money, pay on a line of credit, apply for a line of credit or
open new accounts. The bank offers savings accounts, certificates of deposits and low interest
rates on automobile, housing and personal loans.
The new bank teller (judge) has completed the appropriate industry-related training involved
with starting a job as a bank teller. The new bank teller (judge) has asked you to explain other,
softer skills, the job entails. The new bank teller (judge) wants to know about communications
among bank customers and employees and how positive relationships are made among both.
You will explain your knowledge of emotional intelligence to the new bank teller (judge) in a
role-play to take place at the bank counter. The new bank teller (judge) will begin the role-play
by asking you about soft skills. After you have given the new bank teller (judge) an explanation
and have answered the new bank teller’s (judge’s) questions, the new bank teller (judge) will
conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of an accountant at GEORGE & KEEN, an accounting firm that
manages over 300 business clients. The firm recently began allowing employees to work from
home. A coworker (judge) does not understand why security training is necessary to be able to
work from home. You will describe basic reasons why security is important when working away
from the office.
GEORGE & KEEN is the most trusted accounting firm in the region. With over 300 business
clients and over 200 employees, the firm is well-known. Since it opened in 1967, GEORGE &
KEEN has kept traditional office space, offering executives full offices and other staff members
cubicles. The majority of the accounting work is done via computer rather than face-to-face
client interaction, so not much space is needed.
To keep up with current business trends, executives at GEORGE & KEEN have begun letting
accountants work from home. Accountants are issued a company laptop and other equipment and
must have high speed internet capabilities in their workspace. Before the new work from home
initiative begins, executives have insisted that all employees that want to work from home must
attend a mandatory security training regarding company information, client information and
company equipment.
A coworker that plans to work from home (judge) is unhappy about the mandatory security
training and does not understand why it is necessary. You must explain to the coworker (judge)
basic reasons why the training is essential.
You will explain basic reasons for security training to the coworker (judge) in a role-play to take
place at your coworker’s (judge’s) cubicle. The coworker (judge) will begin the role-play by
asking you about the training. After you have explained reasons to the coworker (judge) and
have answered the coworker’s (judge’s) questions, the coworker (judge) will conclude the roleplay by thanking you for your work.
