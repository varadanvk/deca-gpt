Jones (judge) has been posting inappropriate messages on both Facebook and Twitter about the
customers, staff, and management at Super Subs. Both accounts are private and are only shared
within his/her friend circle. The posts imply that Sam Jones (judge) is not happy with the job and
does not think very highly of the people he/she works with. You are surprised to see these
messages as Sam Jones (judge) usually always has a positive attitude and does an overall good
job while at work.
You have asked Sam Jones (judge) to meet with you before his/her next shift. You want to
discuss with Sam Jones (judge) how his/her actions were inappropriate and how it violated the
employee handbook social media policy that he/she signed when he/she began employment. You
would also like to hear Sam Jones’ explanation for his/her actions. Then you will explain how
derogatory posts from an employee about their workplace affect the company’s brand image and
its relationships with customers, not to mention hurtful to those working with him/her. The
handbook clearly states that consequences are determined on a case by case basis but could range
from a suspension to termination. You will have to decide and tell Sam Jones (judge) the
consequences of his/her actions.
You will explain the situation to Sam Jones (judge) in a role-play to take place in your office.
You will begin by greeting Sam Jones (judge) and asking if he/she knows why you have called
the meeting today. After you have listened to Sam Jones’ (judge) explanation and given your
consequences, you will answer any follow-up questions he/she may have. After you have
answered any questions, you will conclude the role-play.

You are to assume the role of General Manager at Hometown Burger, a small fast-food chain
that is known for their burgers, fries and shakes. The Owner (judge) has asked you to come up
with a new product line that will increase revenue and grow market share.
Hometown Burger was established 12 years ago on the foundation of cooking quality food fast.
The restaurant’s motto of “made-to-order” has left customers coming back for more and helped
launch 4 more locations. Hometown Burger is known for their burgers and fries and delicious
shakes, but has recently adapted to other growing trends such as health conscious choices and
snack sized portions. They have expanded their menu to include salads, wraps, and snack meals
which are smaller portions compared to the deluxe combos.
The Owner (judge) has asked you to come up with the next big product line that will continue to
increase revenue at the restaurants. You have noticed the growing trend of restaurants adding
breakfast items to their menu. When you first mentioned the idea to the Owner (judge), he/she
was hesitant because of the expanded hours of operation and that the move would be too far from
what the restaurant does best. Since that time, the Owner (judge) has decided that it could be
profitable after all, and would like to hear your ideas about this business opportunity.
In your meeting with the Owner (judge) you should explain both the positives and negatives of
offering breakfast at Hometown Burger, innovative menu items that would differentiate from
competitors, and a time frame for implementation.
You will present your ideas to the Owner (judge) in a role-play to take place in the Owner’s
(judge’s) office. The Owner (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear
your ideas. After you have presented and have answered the Owner’s (judge’s) questions, the
Owner (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.
