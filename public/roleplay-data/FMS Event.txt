You are to assume the role of produce manager for FOOD GIANT. The store manager (judge) of
the store has asked you to develop a strategy for maintaining high-quality produce.

FOOD GIANT is a large supermarket with a well-established customer base. The store manager
(judge) wants to maintain a positive image for the store and serve customers in the best way
possible.
In the last few weeks, an increasing number of customers have been returning produce that is not
fresh. You and the store manager (judge) have discussed this trend and are concerned about
expired food not being removed from the shelves in a timely manner. Although stock workers
are careful about keeping the shelves well maintained, they have not been diligent in removing
nearly expired produce from the shelves.

FOOD GIANT has a 50% markdown policy on produce that will expire within three days. Expired
produce is thrown out on the date of expiration. In your review of the policy, you have found that
a large amount of food is being discarded on the date of expiration. You wonder if the store’s
code dating and maintenance of fresh produce is meeting the store’s demands.
The store manager (judge) has asked for your ideas on strategy for maintaining an up-to-date
produce inventory, determining better buying decisions and perhaps setting new reduction prices.
Since the store manager (judge) has mentioned supporting two food banks in the community,
your ideas should consider donations to these agencies.
You will present your ideas to the store manager (judge) in a role-play to take place in the store
manager’s (judge’s) office. The store manager (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you
and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented your ideas and have answered the store
manager’s (judge’s) questions, the store manager (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking
you for your ideas. 

You are to assume the role of an Assistant Manager of the Deli/Bakery at Spend Less Food
Store. The Manager of the Deli/Bakery has asked you to come up with ideas on how the
grocery store can promote the recent hire of an award-winning baker. The new baker is known
for baking a variety of cakes and other items for special occasions. Spend Less Food Store does
an excellent catering business for meetings, parties, weddings, and more. The Manager of the
Deli/Bakery wishes to promote his/her baking services to increase business and to improve the
store’s baking reputation.
Spend Less Food Store is located in a small town of 15,000 people. There are two other large
grocery stores in the community that offer catering services with food and baking. There is also a
very successful specialized catering company called Randy’s Catering that offers food and a
location to host meetings, parties, and weddings; this location can seat up to 600 people. This
catering company specializes in the catering of food; however, they contract out all baked goods
for the events.
Though Spend Less Food Store does a great catering business with food, their catering business
for baking is very small. Since the store is doing the catering with food for many occasions, they
also want to let customers know they offer baking services as well. Spend Less Food Store also
wants to build a relationship with Randy’s Catering to perform some of their baked good needs.
The Manager of the Deli/Bakery is interested in knowing how Spend Less Food Store can
promote their baking and catering business on a limited budget. The Manager has asked you to
identify the exact target market and come up with ideas on how to develop a promotional plan
emphasizing the award winning baker through the use of traditional advertising, social media,
and in-store displays to increase the catering business. Also, the Manager of the Deli/Bakery is
interested in finding ways to develop a strong relationship with Randy’s Catering as they host
over 200 occasions annually.
You will make your presentation to the Deli/Bakery Manager (judge) in a role-play to take place
in the Manager’s (judge’s) office. The Manager (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you
and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented and have answered the Manager’s
(judge’s) questions, the Manager (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your
work.
