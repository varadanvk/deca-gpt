You are to assume the role of a crew member working at an entrance admission counter at
FANTASTIC LAND, a large amusement park. A customer in your line (judge) is upset because
today’s special admission promotion is not applicable to the customer’s (judge’s) party.

and also participates in weekly promotions. On Tuesdays, FANTASTIC LAND has a special “Kids

and under are granted free admission into the park with an adult admission.
A customer (judge) at your counter has purchased admission for two adults and has requested
two free kids’ admissions since it is Tuesday. When asked the ages of the two children, the
customer (judge) answered that one child is 5-years-old and the other is 12-years-old. You then
replied that the 5-year-old could gain free admission, but the 12-year-old is older than the 11-
years-old or younger rule.

offer it to the customer (judge), if needed.
