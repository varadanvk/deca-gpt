You are to assume the role of a small business owner that owns and operates the online jewelry
store, MILKY WAY DESIGNS. You will meet with your business manager (judge) to discuss your
analysis and recommendation for a change in supplier.
MILKY WAY DESIGNS jewelry is based on planets, stars, constellations, moons and other
astronomical bodies. You started the company four years ago and sell your items online.
While you hand design and create all jewelry pieces, you use two vendors’ merchandise to
complete the jewelry pieces. After much research and consideration, you use the company
CHAIN WHOLESALERS for the varying lengths of necklace chains for your pieces and the
company PIECES & MORE for the necklace clasps and earring backs needed to complete the
pieces. Both CHAIN WHOLESALERS and PIECES & MORE have been pleasant to work with and
important parts of the supply chain.
Over the last month, MILKY WAY DESIGNS has been receiving negative customer feedback on
the company website. Several customers have commented that the necklace clasps are cheap and
do not stay closed, resulting in the necklace falling off and the pendant coming off the chain. At
first you thought it was simply user-error, but after a month of continued complaints, you
contacted PIECES & MORE.
Your representative at PIECES & MORE claims that the necklace clasps in your most recent
shipment are indeed the very same necklace clasps you have always received. The representative
suggested that a higher priced necklace clasp, of better quality, might solve your customers’
problems. The higher priced necklace clasp would force you to raise prices on your jewelry items
by $3/necklace and you would still be doing business with the same supplier of the defective
clasps.
Your CHAIN WHOLESALERS representative was happy to detail the available necklace clasps and
earring backs available, all lower quality than PIECES & MORE offerings, which is the reason you
did not choose them for clasps and backs when starting your business.
A third vendor, BITS, has both good quality necklace clasps and earring backs available, but the
vendor’s prices are quite expensive. In order to be profitable, the prices would need to increase
by $5/piece.
You must analyze your supply chain, the three vendor options and make a recommendation.
Your analysis must include business risks and pricing decisions.
You will present your analysis and recommendations to your manager (judge) in a role-play to
take place in the manager’s (judge’s) office. The business manager (judge) will begin the roleplay by greeting you and asking to hear your analysis. After you have presented your analysis
and have answered the business manager’s (judge’s) questions, the manager (judge) will
conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of founder and owner of FARM TO BED, an up-and-coming online
business that sells bedroom linens created by materials grown by local farmers. The general
manager (judge) feels that the company would benefit from joining social media and wants your
advice on how to use social media to build the FARM TO BED brand.
FARM TO BED uses all locally farmed cotton, wool and yarns to create bedroom curtains, sheets
and blankets. Farms across the region sell their cotton, wool and specially made yarns for
material use. The business only uses organic dyes for coloring. In the beginning, you were able
to turn the raw materials into bedroom creations independently, but now that the company has
grown, over 100 employees work in the company warehouse to keep up with demand.
FARM TO BED sells items online, in the store front near the warehouse and at area farmer’s
markets. Online sales have reached an all-time high, and now customers must wait 30 days from
the time an order is placed until delivery.
The general manager (judge) feels that FARM TO BED should have a presence on social media.
The general manager (judge) thinks that social media would help build the FARM TO BED brand
and be extremely useful in customer service.
The general manager (judge) wants you to decide which social media platforms would be the
best fit for FARM TO BED and to explain your reasoning. The manager (judge) also wants you to
determine what content will be showcased on the social media platform(s) you have chosen and
how customers will be encouraged to interact.
You will present your ideas to the manager (judge) in a role-play to take place in the manager’s
(judge’s) office. The general manager (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking
to hear your ideas. After you have presented your ideas and have answered the manager’s
(judge’s) questions, the manager (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your
work.
