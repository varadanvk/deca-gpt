JUDGE SITUATION CHARACTERIZATION

HOMETOWN CINEMA, like most movie theaters, has a strict policy for allowing minors to view
rated R movies. As per the rating guidelines, minors are only allowed to view a rated R movie if
a parent or guardian is accompanying them. If a parent or guardian is not present, the minor is
not allowed into the theater. HOMETOWN CINEMA has its own rule that no minors whatsoever are
allowed into rated R movies after 6:00PM, regardless if accompanied by a parent or guardian.
One of the ticket sales associates has asked the ticket sales manager (participant) to come to the
box office to speak with you. You are angry because there are several minors in the theater of the
3:00PM showing of a rated R movie you are attending. All of the minors are accompanied by
parents or guardians. You feel that the minors should not be allowed in the theater showing the
rated R movie.
The ticket sales manager (participant) will meet with you to discuss the situation in a role-play to
take place at the box office. You will begin the role-play by asking the ticket sales manager

are to ask the following questions of each participant:
1. Why is it so important for you to make sure I am happy?
2. Do you think it would help customer relations if the policy was displayed at the ticket
box office?
After the ticket sales manager (participant) has given solved the issue and has answered your
questions, you will conclude the role-play by thanking the ticket sales manager (participant).
