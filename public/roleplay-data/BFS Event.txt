PLASTICS INC. in the Midwest. Your operations manager, Mr./Ms. Ross (judge), is looking to
expand the business and hire a new employee. The operations manager feels confident that by
hiring another employee it will increase revenue.
Mr./Ms. Ross has asked you to find the expected payroll amounts for the new employee. This
includes being able to calculate the weekly, gross pay, take home pay and cost to the business for
the employee. You will do this by calculating, Federal Income Tax (given to you), State Income
Tax (given), Social Security tax, Medicare tax, Federal Unemployment Tax, and State
Unemployment Tax. You are expected to be able to tell the operations manager how much each
tax is and how much the new employee will cost the company.
 The new employee is expected to work 40 hours per week at $15.00 an hour.
 The new employee has a withholding of 1 (Federal $63, State $27)
 Social Security tax calculated out is $37.20 for the employee and $37.20 for the employer
 Medicare tax calculated out is $8.70 for the employee and $8.70 for the employer.
The employer must pay for the following taxes as well:
 FUTA tax $36.00
 SUTA tax $19.50
On a separate sheet of paper make all of the calculations necessary to give Mr./Ms. Ross the
weekly, gross pay, take home pay and cost the business will incur from the employee. Lastly,
the Operation’s Manager has a weekly budget of $800 for this new employee, does the cost to
the business fall below that number?

operations manager will begin the meeting by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas about
the new employee payroll. After you have presented the information and have answered their
questions, they will conclude the meeting by thanking you for your work.
