JUDGE ROLE-PLAY CHARACTERIZATION
You are to assume the role of COMMISSIONER of the AFA (AMERICAN FOOTBALL
ASSOCIATION). The AFA is the largest American football league in the United States. You
have asked your head financial advisor (participant) to take a look at three quotes for your
Thursday night Football package. You would like to meet with the head financial advisor today
to discuss the quotes and for the participant to present their recommendation.
The league is in quote with three different networks that carry their Sunday and Monday games.
This new Thursday time slot will give the league the ability to reach another audience and
network on another night. The league expects viewership on average of 12 million people each
Thursday and a total of 15 weeks will be played on Thursday nights.
Below are three quotes that have been received from different avenues including online only
hosts, commercial broadcast stations, and cable stations. The math has been completed for you
on the average revenue each deal will bring the AFA.

Table:
Section 1 of table:
Online streaming- Tala
-47 million people have used
Tala services.
-Free viewing service with
in-game advertisements and
a paid service ($10 month)
no advertisements in game.
- Usage by age
-65% of Millennials
-28% of Generation X
-22% of Baby Boomers
Tala will pay the league $6.5
million per game week up
front.
$6.5 million*15 games=
$97.5 million revenue

television networks that
anyone can pick up with an
antenna anywhere in the U.S.

-80% of Generation X
-85% of Baby Boomers
DEF will pay the league $.33
per viewer each week, that

Monday of every week.
12 million*.33=4 million
4 million*15 games=
$60 million

networks.

-60% of Baby Boomers
-ASN will pay the league 50%
of yearly advertising sales
(expected to be $60 million)
in addition $3 million dollars
per game week.
$3 million*15 games=
$45 million+$60 million=
$105 million
The Head Financial Advisor (participant) is to take the following questions into consideration
when preparing a recommendation:
 What are the different prices for viewers/customers to watch the game?
o Tala has either ads customers will have to watch during the game, or they must
pay $10 a month to remove the ads.

o Depending on their decision, it could be demographics maybe they want a
younger market. They can go with the largest viewing population. They may go
with the largest revenue.
 What factors can affect how much revenue the AFA makes during Thursday night
Football?
o For the DEF deal it is contingent on viewers, if a large amount of viewers watch
the more money the league will be paid. For the ASN deal it is based on
advertising dollars the more advertising that ASN receives the more AFA can
receive.
The Head Financial Advisor (participant) will present to you in a meeting to take place in your
office. You will begin the meeting by greeting the Head Financial Advisor and asking to hear
about his/her recommendation.
During the course of the meeting you are to ask the following questions of each participant:
1. Do you believe that having a viewer have to purchases a subscription of some kind will
decrease our viewership?
1. Possible Solutions: It may lower viewers in certain age ranges. If you go with
online streaming Generation X and Baby boomers have not yet jumped on to the
online streaming services, yet Millennials are not hooked up to cable as the other
two age groups are.
2. What are some of the characteristics that matter about our viewing customers?
1. Possible Solutions: This may include demographics like: age, gender, income,
nationality, education, and ethnicity, geographics and psychographics like:
attitudes, aspirations, interests, opinions and beliefs.

The budget analyst (participant) was given this information from you to be able to complete the
payroll.
 The new employee is expected to work 40 hours per week at $15.00 an hour.
 The new employee has a withholding of 1 (Federal $63, State $27)
 Social Security tax calculated out is $37.20 for the employee and $37.20 for the employer
 Medicare tax calculated out is $8.70 for the employee and $8.70 for the employer
The employer must pay for the following taxes as well:
 FUTA tax $36.00
 SUTA tax $19.50
The meeting will take place in your office. You will begin the meeting by greeting the budget
analyst and asking to their ideas about the new employee payroll.
During the course of the meeting you are to ask the following questions of each participant:
1. We have not taken into account the amount of revenue this employee will bring in, is this
something that important to consider when adding an employee?
a. Possible Solutions- This is an important part of hiring an employee. Having just
the expense portion for the employee does not tell the whole story. The
participant should talk about the extra revenue the employee can make, by
decreasing time of production and adding sales for the company.
2. Do we have to worry about insurance, retirement, or other benefits for this employee?
a. Possible Solutions: With the Affordable healthcare act we do have to offer
healthcare to full time employees. Other items like retirement, dental, and other
benefits are optional, but may motivate candidates to apply for the job.
Once the budget analyst (participant) has presented the information and has answered your
questions, you will conclude the meeting by thanking the budget analyst (participant) for their
research and assistance.
You are not to make any comments after the event is over expect to thank the participant.

State Income tax = $27.00 (Amount provided to students)
Social Security Tax = $37.20 (Amount provided to students)
Medicare Tax = $8.70 (Amount provided to students)
Take Home Pay = Gross Weekly Pay – Tax Deductions – Social Security - Medicare
 $464.10 = $600 - $63.00 - $27 - $37.20 - $8.70
Amount that the employer must budget
Social Security Tax employer = $37.20 (Amount provided to students)
Medicare Tax = $8.70 (Amount provided to students)
Federal Unemployment Tax = $36.00 (Amount provided to students)
State Unemployment Tax = $19.50 (Amount provided to students)
Cost to the employer = Gross Weekly Pay + Social Security + Medicare + Fed Unemployment
+ State Unemployment
$701.40 = $600 + $37.20 + $8.70 + $36.00 + $19.50
