You are to assume the role of marketing manager at SUZANNE’S BRIDAL, a regional chain of
stores that specialize in bridal gowns, prom dresses and other formalwear. The owner of the
chain (judge) has asked you to decide what changes should be made to store mannequins so that
they better represent real customers.
SUZANNE’S BRIDAL is the number one bridal gown retailer in the area. Each store is elegantly
decorated, has several personal attendants (sales associates) on staff and boats the largest
inventory of both designer and bargain bridal and formal apparel. Each of the 35 store locations
attracts brides-to-be and prom dress shoppers from miles away because the stores carry dresses
in sizes 0-26. Other bridal stores simply stock sample gowns in a standard size.
Each store has more than a dozen mannequins that display the various styles, brands and quality
of wedding gowns and prom dresses. Every mannequin was uniform; all 5’7’’ tall and able to
display a size 4 wedding or prom dress. The purpose of the mannequins was to give shoppers an
idea of what the dress looks like on a real person, rather than just on a hanger.
Research shows that 42% of shoppers say that mannequins influence buying decisions. A
shopper can be encouraged to try on a new style if it is displayed on a mannequin. The owner
(judge) has decided to replace some of the mannequins in the store. The owner (judge) feels that
the mannequins should represent the real shoppers and not just the uniform 5’7’’ size 4 standard.
The owner (judge) has asked you to recommend changes to the mannequins that SUZANNE’S
BRIDAL uses to make them marketable to more people.
You will present your proposed changes to the owner of the shop (judge) in a role-play to take
place in the owner’s (judge’s) office. The owner (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you
and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented your proposed changes and have
answered the owner’s (judge’s) questions, the owner (judge) will conclude the role-play by
thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of new general manager of SPERRY’S CLOTHING, an independent
clothing store. The owner (judge) has asked you to develop a plan to improve the profit margin
of the store quickly.
SPERRY’S CLOTHING is an independent clothing store located in a medium-size city in the upper
Midwest. SPERRY’S features upscale, fashionable lines of clothing and accessories for younger
women. Now operated by the second generation of the Sperry family, for 43 years the store has
stayed contemporary and profitable.
The Sperry family has recently hired you as the general manager for their store. The previous
manager was let go for poor performance. The family is most concerned about declining profit
margins, even though gross sales have been strong. You are expected to improve the profit
margin for the store quickly. The owner (judge) has asked you to present your analysis of the
situation and a preliminary plan on how best to address it.
Key information to consider:
• A review of sales reports from the past five years shows a steady downward trend in the
maintained margin on all of SPERRY’S lines. The change is the greatest on trendy, seasonal
apparel.
• Vendors are increasing their pressure to buy in larger quantity early; it is difficult to fill in
stock on seasonal apparel once the season is under way.
• During the past five years, big box department stores like Kohl’s and Target have been
opening in your market area.
• You have noticed many of your customers wearing clothing purchased from catalog and online retailers such as Lands’ End and Eddie Bauer.
• Fashion trends have been changing more quickly than in the past, especially on business
apparel.
• The store enjoys a high degree of customer loyalty. Customers are very aware of the sales
that run at regular intervals throughout the year.
You are to create an analysis of the decreasing profit margins and develop a preliminary plan for
improving profit margins and present it to the storeowner (judge).
Be sure your presentation includes the following:
• Possible causes of the decreasing margin
• An explanation of how overall gross sales can be steady or increasing while profit margins
decrease
• Ideas on how to control inventory levels to avoid excessive markdowns
• Specific plans on how to increase profit margins
You will present your plan in a role-play to take place in the owner’s (judge’s) office. The owner
(judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear your presentation. After you
have presented your information and have answered the owner’s (judge’s) questions, the owner
(judge) will conclude the event by thanking you for your work.
