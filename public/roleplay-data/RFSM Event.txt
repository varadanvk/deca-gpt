You are to assume the role of FRONT-END MANAGER at THE SUMMIT, a full-service
restaurant that offers a casual dining experience. THE OWNER, Mr./Ms. Brown (judge), has asked
you to develop a checklist for all wait staff to follow to ensure all customers receive not only
quality food but quality service.
The Summit has been serving customers since 1993. The restaurant is open daily from 4 pm – 10
pm with a dinner menu that includes appetizers, dinner entrees, various sides, desserts and a full
selection of items from the bar. There are also nightly specials, seasonal menu items and carry-out
options.
Over the last few months the owner has noticed more and more customers posting comments and
ratings on various social media sites regarding their recent visits at The Summit. While many of
the ratings and comments praise the menu options and food preparation, the comments about the
wait staff and service received have been increasingly negative. Mr./Ms. Brown has been unable
to pinpoint which servers are responsible for this customer dissatisfaction but it is certain these
posts have begun to have a negative effect on business.
To combat the negative posts and encourage more positive posts, Mr./Ms. Brown asked you to
develop a step-by-step checklist that all wait staff will follow when serving customers. The owner
would like the checklist to:
 Be steps that new and veterans servers could easily follow
 Establish a standardized way to interact and serve all customers
 Demonstrate the customer service mindset
 Ensure customers are engaged during their entire dining experience
You will present your ideas and checklist with Mr./Ms. Brown in a meeting that will take place in
their office. The owner will begin the meeting by greeting you and asking you to share what you
have developed. After you have shared your ideas and have answered their questions, they will
conclude the meeting by thanking you for your work.

You are to assume the role of MANAGER for THE CITY GRILL, a locally-owned restaurant in
a vibrant downtown area. Mr./Ms. Stevens, the owner (judge), has asked you to develop a
promotional plan to help increase sales.
In recent years the downtown business retailers association has added numerous events and
activities to increase consumer traffic. One of those events is ‘Food Truck Fridays’ where on
Friday evenings food trucks line a three-block area and consumers walk amongst the trucks to try
new foods and visit local shops.
The ‘Food Truck Fridays’ event runs from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. every Friday from Memorial
Day to Labor Day. The parking locations for the food trucks are less than one block from the front
entrance of The City Grill. Since the start of ‘Food Truck Fridays’, your business has dropped by
30% on Friday evenings, which used to be The City Grill’s biggest night of the week.
The City Grill has been open for 12 years in the same location and has become a local favorite. It
is open from 11:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., 7 days a week serving lunch and dinner, and the restaurant
is known for having a regular menu that features modern takes on American classic dishes,
appetizers and small desserts. There is also a full-service bar and lounge, and the chef likes to
surprise diners with a rotation of new and different specials featuring seasonal produce.
Mr./Ms. Stevens, the owner (judge) of The City Grill, has asked you to develop a promotional plan
to help combat the drop in revenue during ‘Food Truck Fridays.’ The owner would like you to
create different options of promotional materials and activities that can be used and seen by those
who attend or are thinking about attending ‘Food Truck Fridays.’
You will present your ideas to Mr./Ms. Stevens (judge) in a meeting to take place at the restaurant
before opening at 11:00 a.m. The owner will begin the meeting by greeting you and asking to hear
your ideas. After you have shared your ideas and have answered their questions, they will conclude
the meeting by thanking you for your work.


You are to assume the role of the general manager of SUSHI HOUSE, an upscale restaurant in a large city.
The owner (judge) wants you to determine how to manage the popularity of a kid’s menu item.
SUSHI HOUSE is an upmarket sushi restaurant. Since the menu prices are so high, most customers know a
lot about sushi and are fans of the dish. SUSHI HOUSE’S menu is not large and only includes classic,
tempura and signature rolls. There are no side dishes or dessert items on the menu.
If a child under the age of 12 is present and does not want to order sushi, a kid’s meal is offered. There
is only one option for the kid’s meal, and it includes six chicken nuggets, a side of macaroni and cheese
and a fruit cup for $10.00.
A local food blogger recently wrote about his experience at SUSHI HOUSE. The piece was extremely
positive and mentioned SUSHI HOUSE’S amazing food, its courteous staff and classy atmosphere. The
blogger also was impressed with the kid’s meal that was offered to his 5-year-old daughter. The majority
of the blog went on to describe the SUSHI HOUSE macaroni and cheese as the best macaroni and cheese
in the city. The blog has caused an influx of new customers coming to SUSHI HOUSE wanting to order
the kid’s meal.
The owner (judge) wants you to analyze SUSHI HOUSE’S current policy of only offering kid’s meals to
children under the age of 12. The owner (judge) wants your analysis to include:
• Effects on the SUSHI HOUSE corporate brand
• Effects on SUSHI HOUSE product branding
• An appropriate method to meet customer demand
You will present your analysis to the owner (judge) in a role-play to take place in the owner’s (judge’s)
office. The owner (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear your ideas. After
you have presented ideas and have answered the owner’s (judge’s) questions, the owner (judge) will
conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.
